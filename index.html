    <h3>Equilateral triangle</h3>
    <p>In geometry, an equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all <span class="sides">three sides are equal</span>. In the familiar Euclidean geometry, equilateral triangles are also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°.<p>
    <h3>Isosceles triangle</h3>
    <p>An isosceles triangle is a triangle with<span class="sides"> (at least) two equal sides</span>. In the figure above, the two equal sides have length and the remaining side has length . This property is equivalent to two angles of the triangle being equal. An isosceles triangle therefore has both two equal sides and two equal angles.</p>
    <h3>Scalene triangle</h3
     <p>A scalene triangle is a triangle that has <span class="sides">three unequal sides</span>.It has angles of different degrees</p>
